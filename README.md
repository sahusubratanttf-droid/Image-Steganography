Image Steganography in C

A simple Image Steganography project developed in C that hides and extracts secret data inside BMP image files using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.

📌 Features
Encode secret data into BMP image
Decode hidden data from stego image
Uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique
Command-line based execution
Proper error handling
File handling using C
🛠 Technologies Used
C Programming
File Handling
Bitwise Operations
BMP Image Processing
